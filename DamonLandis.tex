\section{Introduction}

Chemistry is the foundation for almost everything we know and experience in the world around us. It allows us to stay clean, keep our bodies nourished, and many other things that are a part of our daily lives. Chemistry can tell us why flowers are pink and why the sky is blue. Without this building block of our universe, we as humanity would be lost in the way of understanding our world. Chemistry shapes the earth in a fascinating way.


\section{Explanation}

Did you know that chemistry even has to do with the water that you drink? In chemistry terms, water is referred to as H2O. This means that a water molecule is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. These atoms are bonded together in a molecular bond. Water and many other substances we encounter everyday have chemical formulas just like this one.

\begin{equation}

  \label{eq:1}
  \H2O = order*\2H + \O
\end{equation}
